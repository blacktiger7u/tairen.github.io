            <h2>PRODUCTIVITY IN GENERAL</h2>
            <p>Recently I've talked with my friend about achieving 100% focus. After long discussion and
            exploring every possible idea what could possibly be the case and THE ONE subject which i believe answers for probably 90% of the productivity is:</p>
            <h2>MENTAL CLARITY</h2>
            <p>I recently experienced this and I must say its critical: MENTAL CLARITY is the key to productivity.</p>
            <p>
            Actually yesterday i had a fun situation, my other friend told me that he got invited to come over by a girl.
            The thing is, he never had a girlfriend... So he was really scared. We are in senior year of high school and
            at the may next we will have to take final exams. He couldn't focus for the rest of the day!. this got me thinking,
            does it also occur to everybody? After a short realization I believe that I solved a puzzle.</p<
                <p>I'm always unable to focus
            with a lot of things going on in my head. I always have a lot of different thoughts and worries(thats the reason i probably write this blog).
            Recently I had a big talking stage, everything was okay, my mind was clear, thought that I GOT IT. Unfortunately, after a while
            things started to go shit again. This chigga came to my house, kissed me and then randomly wrote some fucked up essay and blocked me.
            I lowkey got heartbroken and cant mentally set my self for a relationship because of being scared of situation happening again.
            Coming back to the topic - I also have a hard time focusing BECAUSE OF RANDOM THOUGHTS. Sometimes I think about her, the future, exams etc.
            The solution is actually pretty simple - stop thinking! In lots of cases its impossible but if you can just take you mind off something - well played.</p>
            <p>MY RECOMMENDATION: there's actually this app called <a href="http://kairu.app">kairu.app</a>, its actually nice productivity tracker with tags simple UI and stats.
            Pomodoro actually works - 25min work/7min break works the best. When the thoughts are coming what you do is - you say to youself "Let me deal with it in [time when your break starts]."
            THAT ACTUALLY WORKS!. And also other thing - sleep. Get some sleep because even when you get mental clarity but ur tired - you won't do SHIT.</p>
